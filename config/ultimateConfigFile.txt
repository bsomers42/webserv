To be included (not necessarily in one config file)

* Testing finding the index file 
	- (include multiple index files in the "/" location)
	- also autoindex (on/off) - this still needs to be included int the code


* Testing error pages
	- put all error pages in folder /error_pages
	- make a location for /defaultError.html

* Test multiple servers with same IP:port and different server_name

* location for cgi (/uploaded.html)
